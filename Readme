NickNames
=========

This is a database of first name equivalence classes. Given a common first name, this class will return an array of possible substitute names (nick names).

This list of names can then be used to build a search in Rails that, for example, return all Bobs, if you search for Robert, and vice versa.


Example
=======

    NickNames['bob'] == ["bill", "billy", "bob", "bobby", "rob", "robby", "robert"]

To build a nickname-insensitive 
    conditions = []
    first_names_cond_sql = (["first_name SOUNDS LIKE ?"]*first_names.size).join(' OR ')
    conditions << "((#{first_names_cond_sql}) AND last_name SOUNDS LIKE ?) AND (people.listed = ? AND users.state = ?)"
